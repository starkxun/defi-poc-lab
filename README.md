# PoC Lab – Smart Contract Exploit Research

This repository contains **reproducible Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs)**  
for real-world smart contract vulnerabilities.

## Scope
- AMM math & rounding errors
- Flashloan callback abuse
- Invariant manipulation
- Cross-protocol composability risks

## Tooling
- Foundry
- Mainnet fork
- Custom invariant & math scripts

## Structure
Each PoC includes:
- Minimal exploit contract
- Failing invariant / broken assumption
- Reproducible test

> Educational & research purpose only.
